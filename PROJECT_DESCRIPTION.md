# Project Description

**Deployed Frontend URL:** https://task5-ackee.vercel.app/

**Solana Program ID:** 4iRSVdRWZBJiokynBtsReFyBZ8epDy2E8a9XRk3jEY1N

## Project Overview

### Description

This project is a decentralized Twitter-like dApp built on the Solana blockchain.  
It allows users to post short messages (“tweets”) that are stored on-chain in a censorship resistant and transparent way. Each tweet is uniquely tied to the author’s wallet through a Program Derived Address (PDA), ensuring authenticity and ownership. Users can also delete their own tweets, reclaiming the lamports used to create the account.

### Key Features

- Feature 1: **Post Tweets** — Users can create short tweets (up to 250 characters) directly on-chain.
- Feature 2: **Delete Tweets** — Authors can delete their tweets, which closes the PDA and refunds lamports.
- Feature 3: **Immutable Ownership** — Each tweet is linked to its creator’s wallet and cannot be modified by others.
- Feature 4: **Timestamped Records** — Tweets include an on-chain timestamp, ensuring verifiable chronology.

### How to Use the dApp

1. **Connect Wallet**  
   Open the frontend and connect your Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare).

2. **Main Action 1: Post a Tweet**

   - Enter your message (≤ 250 characters).
   - Submit the transaction.
   - A new PDA tweet account is created and stored on Solana.

3. **Main Action 2: View Tweets**

   - Tweets are fetched from on-chain accounts.
   - Users can see the content, author, and timestamp.

4. **Main Action 3: Delete a Tweet**
   - If you are the author, you can delete your tweet.
   - The account is closed, and lamports are returned to your wallet.

## Program Architecture

The program is written using the Anchor framework and defines two main instructions (`send_tweet` and `delete_tweet`). Each tweet is stored in its own PDA account that holds the author’s key, the tweet content, and the creation timestamp.

### PDA Usage

Tweets are stored in deterministic Program Derived Addresses to ensure uniqueness.

**PDAs Used:**

- PDA 1: **Tweet Account** — Derived using seeds:
  - `"tweet"` (static seed to namespace tweet accounts)
  - `sender.key()` (ensures tweets are tied to a specific user)
  - `bump` (auto-generated by Anchor for PDA validity)

### Program Instructions

**Instructions Implemented:**

- Instruction 1: **send_tweet** — Creates a new tweet account PDA, validates content length (≤ 250 chars), and stores author, content, and timestamp.
- Instruction 2: **delete_tweet** — Closes the tweet account PDA, returning lamports to the author’s wallet.

### Account Structure

````rust
#[account]
pub struct Tweet {
    pub author: Pubkey,    // The wallet that created the tweet
    pub content: String,   // The tweet message (max 250 chars)
    pub timestamp: i64,    // Unix timestamp from Clock
}

## Testing

### Test Coverage
The program is tested using the Anchor Mocha/Chai testing framework. Tests cover both successful (happy path) and failure (unhappy path) scenarios to ensure correct program behavior.

**Happy Path Tests:**
- **Can send a tweet:**
  Verifies that a new tweet can be created, and the account correctly stores the author’s public key, content, and timestamp.
- **Can delete a tweet:**
  Ensures that the tweet account can be deleted by its author and that attempting to fetch the account afterwards fails because it no longer exists.

**Unhappy Path Tests:**
- **Fails when tweet is too long:**
  Attempts to create a tweet with 251 characters (exceeding the 250 character limit) and confirms that the transaction fails with the `Errors::ContentTooLong` message.
- **Fetching deleted account:**
  After deletion, fetching the account results in an error (`Account does not exist`), ensuring proper closure behavior.
